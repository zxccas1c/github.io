            <b>videocard</b><br>
            A graphics card, also known as a video card, 
            is a hardware component that is responsible for rendering and displaying images, 
            videos, and animations on a computer. 
            It consists of a processor, memory, and a cooling system. 

            The graphics card is essential for running high-quality games, 
            video editing, graphic design, and other graphics-intensive applications. 
            It provides a graphical interface between the computer and the display, 
            allowing images and videos to be displayed in high-definition quality..<br>
            <br>
            <b>processor</b><br>
            The processor, also known as the central processing unit (CPU), 
            is the "brain" of a computer. 
            It is the primary component responsible for executing instructions and 
            performing calculations. The processor is responsible for managing all 
            the processes within the computer and controlling the overall performance 
            of the system.<br>
            <br>
            <b>motherboard</b><br>
            A motherboard is the main circuit board of 
            a computer that connects all the other components together. 
            It serves as a communication hub that allows the various 
            hardware components, including the processor, memory, and 
            input/output (I/O) devices, to interact with each other. <br>
            <br>
            <b>System memory</b><br>
            System memory, also known as random-access memory (RAM), 
            is a type of computer memory that is used 
            to store and access data temporarily while the 
            computer is running. The system memory serves as a 
            temporary storage space for the data that needs to be 
            accessed frequently by the processor.
